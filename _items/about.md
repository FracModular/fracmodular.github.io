# Frac Modular 

This repo is dedicated to the preservation of information for the Frac Modular format.

It will hold info / manuals / tidbits from various (some of them discontinued) modules from
companies like Blacet (RIP), Paia etc. 

##  Panel format

Like the Eurorack format, Frac is considered a 3U format. The height of most modern modular synthesizer modules is measured by the number of vertical units it consumes in a standard 19" equipment rack. 

Modules conforming to the 3U format will take up three vertical units in a 19" equipment rack. 
Each vertical rack unit is 1 3/4", so a 3U module is 5 3/4" (133.35 mm) tall. 
The Frac format has a standard width unit of 1 1/2". 
So 3" (76.2 mm) and 4 1/2" (114.3) wide modules are common in this format

##  Difference between Frac rack and Eurorack

Although both Frac and Euro modules are 3U, use V/octave and have similar signal levels the modules aren't interchangeable. 
Frac modules are deeper and have a different mounting system. The module power connectors are different and so are the voltages; 

Frac modules are powered with ±15V and Eurorack with ±12V. Check the specs of individual modules for CV compatibility.
To patch between a banana Frac system and a Euro system a common ground connection will need to be made.


##  Patching

Frac format modules typically use 3.5 mm connectors and plugs for patching, although there are companies that offer modules with banana jacks e.g. BugBrand, Metalbox

## Power

Power requirements for Frac modules are typically ±15VDC. Current draw depends on the module. The power connectors are 4 way AMP MTA-156 headers. The control voltage is 1V/octave.

PAiA P9700S modules are designed for an ±18V unregulated power with on module regulation where necessary, although ±15V regulated supplies can be used.
