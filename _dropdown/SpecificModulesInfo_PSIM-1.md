PSIM-1 was made in 2004 by synthmodules.com (with help from Wiard).
It has a micro controller that is programable via a PC based development
environment that supports a BASIC language. Programs can be installed
by a 9-pin serial DIN connector. There are four general purpose inputs,
four general purpose outputs, an AUX in/out, a reset button, a start in/out
and button, a stop in/out and button, a stop LED, a run LED, and four
monitor LEDs.
