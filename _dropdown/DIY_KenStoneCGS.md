### Early years

Ken Stone is an over-enthusiastic synth hobbyist who started dabbling when modular synthesizers were both rare and expensive. 
His initial exposure to them was in 1974 when he heard the album "Popcorn" by Elektrik Cokernut. 
Not long after that, his travelling music teacher brought his newly acquired Minimoog to school.

It would be several years before Ken was able to get a synth of his own. In the mean time, DIY electronics 
was the only way he could produce any sound-makers. It wasn't until December 1980 that he was able to convince his 
father to buy him one, and even then, it was a very minimal system â€“ modular, of course. 
That synthesizer was a Roland System 100M modular, specifically, one 110 VCO-VCF-VCA module, 
one 140 2 ENV-LFO, one 191J 5 module system rack, and the 181 49 keyboard controller. 

The only way to fill the gaps in the 191J was DIY. Unfortunately, back in those days, 
information was scarce and key parts were impossible to find.

### CGS

Fast forwarding to the late 1990s, Ken discovered other modular synth fans on the internet, and was soon 
offering the fruits of his DIY hobby to others, in the form of a web site (CGS) that detailed his projects, 
and for those who were interested, PCBs for them as well. His intention was to help others build their own synths. 

As his own synth grew, so did his web site, and the number of designs available.

### Serge


A number of times after designing what he thought was a new and innovative module he would discover 
it had already been done before, by Serge Tcherepnin. After that he looked closer at Serge Systems 
and liked what he saw, adopting the form factor for his own PCBs. Serge Tcherepnin was contacted, and soon, by agreement, 
Serge's designs were also being made available to DIYers again.

### Now

From the late 1990s until early 2016, Ken sold PCBs associated with his designs, under the flag CGS.
In 2016 Ken retired from selling PCBs, passing both his designs and those of Serge to Laurie Biddulph of Elby Designs

His designs can be found in PDF format [here](https://github.com/FracModular/CGS_Synth) as well, as a backup place.

For people that cannot DIY [Metalbox](http://www.metalbox.com/) is still offering CGS modules in Frac format even in 2020!
