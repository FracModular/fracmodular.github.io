PSIM-1 was made in 2004 by synthmodules.com (with help from Wiard).
It has a micro controller that is programable via a PC based development
environment that supports a BASIC language. Programs can be installed
by a 9-pin serial DIN connector. There are four general purpose inputs,
four general purpose outputs, an AUX in/out, a reset button, a start in/out
and button, a stop in/out and button, a stop LED, a run LED, and four
monitor LEDs.

During the end of 2019 the place where a lot of programs for PSIM-1 were stored went down
(the synthmodules yahoo group)

Thankfully an archive from that group has been downloaded and can be found [here](https://github.com/FracModular/PSIM-1-related)
