We classify switches by the number of "poles" and the number of "throws". 

The number of "throws" is the number of lever or button positions in which the switch completes a circuit.

The simplest switch is a **"single pole single throw (SPST)"**, which has two contacts. 
When the switch is on, it completes the circuit between the two contacts; when the switch is off, the circuit is open.


A "double pole" switch is basically two separate switches connected to the same lever or button. 
The **"double pole double throw" (DPDT)** is pretty widely used. It has a total of six contacts -- a 1, 2, and 3 for each half of the switch. 
There is no connection between the two halves.

Some catalogs describe the positions of a switch using a different notation, 
for example, a single-pole single-throw switch is described as "on-off" 
and a double throw is described as "on-on". 
A double throw with a center off is "on-off-on". 
If the switch is spring loaded in one position, such that it snaps back when released, 
that position is shown in parentheses, so a "on-off-(on)" is a double-throw switch with center off 
and one of the on positions spring-loaded.

If you need a switch with more than three selections, you need a rotary switch. 
Rotary switches usually have 6, 8, or 12 on positions; it's possible to get double-pole rotaries 
which basically are two switch bodies on the same shaft. 
Most rotaries have a stop mechanism you can set so that if your circuit doesn't use all of the available positions, 
you can prevent it from being turned to the unused positions.
