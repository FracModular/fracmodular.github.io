Introduction:


In latter model synthesizers, digital noise sources began to appear in place of analog ones. Traditionally, 
a psuedo-random shift register set up for optimal length. By optimal length, it is meant that every state 
of all available bits will appear at some time, but the order is unknown. Essentially a counter that counts 
in an unknown order. This represents the maximum state of information "entropy" available for that number of bits.

But music has close self-similarity over short periods of time. That is, it repeats itself with changes appearing slowly. 
This shift register generator is designed to give control of the rate of appearance of new information. 
It has a tight set of controls over how random it actually is and how fast change occurs.


Tone Wheels and Noise Rings:

Clocked at audio rates, the shift register forms a kind of synthetic "tone wheel", similar in idea to the electromechanical 
tone wheels in organs. But with very crude quantization, and hence very "noisy". To some extent you can visualize the 
resistor summers (DACS - digital to analog converters) like the lines of magnetic force around a metallic tone wheel. 
Different summers form different kinds of pickups. It is actually a digital transversal filter, but the "pickup" idea is 
helpful.

All voltage ranges are from 0 to 10 volts. The Aux Output (n+1) will change between one of 9 voltage levels. 
The Output (2^n) will change between one of 256 voltage levels.

Noise Source:

The module contains an internal analog white noise generator. Random digital data is generated by using two 
comparators to compare the noise voltage against two DC voltages. 
One comparator generates a controllable density of zeros or ones. The second comparator controls the solid state 
switch which which selects between recycling old data in the shift register, or getting new data from the outside. 
If the "CHANGE" control is set to 100%, ALL new data is shifted through the register. 
With the "CHANGE " control set to 0%, only old data is recycled through the shift register without change.

CLOCK:

A wide range voltage controlled oscillator is used to clock the shift register. 
The 4 decade range from 1 Hertz to 10 Kilohertz, allows the generation of audio rate sound 
and also control voltage sequences. The VCO has a coarse set front panel control and an external control voltage input 
with attenuator.
