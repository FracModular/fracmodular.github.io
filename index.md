This repo is dedicated to the preservation of information for the Frac Modular format.

During 2019 I have decided to move a bit more more towards this format  
(from 6U now im close to 18U).

This space will hold info / manuals / tidbits for various (some of them discontinued) modules from
companies like Blacet (RIP), Paia etc. 

Have a look around. You might find interesting things. Or not.
