# Frac Modular 

This repo is dedicated to the preservation of information for the Frac Modular format.

It will hold info / manuals / tidbits from various (some of them discontinued) modules from
companies like Blacet (RIP), Paia etc. 

##  Panel format

Like the Eurorack format, Frac is considered a 3U format. The height of most modern modular synthesizer modules is measured by the number of vertical units it consumes in a standard 19" equipment rack. Modules conforming to the 3U format will take up three vertical units in a 19" equipment rack. Each vertical rack unit is 1 3/4", so a 3U module is 5 3/4" (133.35 mm) tall. The Frac format has a standard width unit of 1 1/2". So 3" (76.2 mm) and 4 1/2" (114.3) wide modules are common in this format.[1]

##  Difference between Frac rack and Eurorack

Although both Frac and Euro modules are 3U, use V/octave and have similar signal levels the modules aren't interchangeable. Frac modules are deeper and have a different mounting system. The module power connectors are different and so are the voltages; Frac modules are powered with ±15V and Eurorack with ±12V. Check the specs of individual modules for CV compatibility. To patch between a banana Frac system and a Euro system a common ground connection will need to be made.[2][4][5][6][7]

##  Patching

Frac format modules typically use 3.5 mm connectors and plugs for patching, although there are companies that offer modules with banana jacks e.g. BugBrand, Metalbox.[8][9]

## Power

Power requirements for Frac modules are typically ±15VDC. Current draw depends on the module. The power connectors are 4 way AMP MTA-156 headers. The control voltage is 1V/octave.[1][2][4] PAiA P9700S modules are designed for an ±18V unregulated power with on module regulation where necessary, although ±15V regulated supplies can be used.[10]


## Frac brands

    Ad Infinitum
    Analog Metropolis
    Barton
    Blacet Research
    BugBrand (only banana jacks)
    CGS usually availiable through Metalbox if you cannot DIY
    Flight of Harmony
    j3rk
    Metalbox
    MFOS – not format specific and can be powered by +/-15V[12]
    Oakley Sound Systems – some support for Frac and some 5U PCBs can fit behind a Frac panel.[13]
    PAIA 
    Stroh Modular
    Synthasonic
    Synthesis Technology MOTM – never supported Frac but some 5U PCBs will fit behind a Frac panel.[13]
    Wiard
   

Currently Metalbox is the only one thats open to business availiable to buy things from. 
But you might find modules from the rest of the brands too...look on Ebay/Reverb

synthcube is a great resource for PCB/Panel/Kits etc in Frac Format



## Some modules that work on +/- 15V so they are suitable for Frac DIY

### 4ms:

Shuffling Clock Multiplier: works on +/-12-15v

Rotating Clock Divider: works on +/-12-15v

Noise Swash: works on +/-9-15v

Atoner: works on +/-12-15v 


### Flight of Harmony:

Choices: operates on +/-9-15V

Plague Bearer: operates on +/-9-15V

V'Amp: operates on +/-9-15V

Sound of Shadows: operates on +/-12-15v


### Blacet to Doepfer Power Connector

Some Blacet Modules will work on +/-12V and some Doepfer Modules will work on +/-15V...
