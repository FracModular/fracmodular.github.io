2019 has been a tumultuous year for many. It also was marked with the unfortunate passing of two very influential people in the 
synth community. John Blacet and Mike McGrath

## John Blacet

John Blacet was one of the people responsible for the proliferation of modular synthesizers at a time when they werent so
ubiquitous. 

I was lucky enough to come in contact with his brand of modular synthesis at around 2011. 

I liked the no-nonsense workmanlike modules with clever design and normalisations. 
I also liked the black uniformity of his modules but also the uniformity of knob placement
and other things that after a while start to matter. 

I am an equal opportunity wiggler having euro/frac/100m modules in my studio but my the euro is always for the 
add-ons/exotic/digital modules.This is why I have never felt compelled to have more than 2 * 3U rows of it. In my case Blacet and 100m were always the main meat and potatoes.


I liked what MatrixSynth (the synth news aggregator) wrote so Im going to quote it here.

      Im assuming anyone that comes to this site is familiar with Blacet and his Frac rack format modules.
      He was creating modular synths before the modular scene became popular, before eurorack took off. 
      Back then Frac was king for many. Blacet along with Modcan and Cynthia were it.
      Eurorack may have taken over, especially now that there is a market to support it, but back then, 
      pioneers like John Blacet provided a small oasis for the world of modular, after years, if not decades, 
      of being forgotten for mainstream synths. 
      
      John helped keep the modular world alive, when by all circumstances it should have been lost. 
      We have him and the handful of boutique manufacturers to thank for what we have now. 
     

In a positive development synthcube has acquired the rights for Blacet work. This will mean that John's work will be availiable 
once again ... and perhaps there are a few other suprises along the way


## Mike McGrath



Mike was responsible for creating one of the most influential forums for electronic modular instruments. 
If not for Mike ,there wouldnt be this explosion of boutique modular   




this thread I think is a testament on how many lives he has touched. 
For a bit after his passing everyone was worried on what is going to happen to their most favourite place on the internet.
Thankfully the site now is in good hands. With a lot of work throughout Christmas from his brother
and a Patreon setup for donations its fair to say the existance of Muffwiggler forums is assured.
